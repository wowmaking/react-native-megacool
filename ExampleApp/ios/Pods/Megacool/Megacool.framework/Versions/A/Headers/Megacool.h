 scale factor is increased to ensure a minimum of 200 or more in both dimensions. By passing in a

 larger scale factor will produce encoded media with a higher resolution, it will make captures and
 encoding slower, and also increase the size of the encoded media, which will increase both disk and
 network usage. In any case, we will round up the scaled dimensions to be divisible by 16, as this

 followed by `disableFeatures:kMCLFeatureAnalytics` would leave only analytics disabled.
 Combine features with the bitwise OR operator `|` to disable multiple features, like
 `disableFeatures:kMCLFeatureAnalytics|kMCLFeatureGifUpload`.

 The supported features you can disable is:
 * GIFs: Disable all recording, frame capturing and subsequent creation of the GIF. Available
 as the constant `kMCLFeatureGifs.`
 * GIF uploading: By default all GIFs created are uploaded to our servers, which is
 necessaryto be able to share GIFs to Facebook and Twitter, and for you to see them in the
 dashboard. This does have some networking overhead though, so if you're very constrained in terms
 of bandwidth you can disable this. Include the constant `kMCLFeatureGifUpload.`
 * Analytics: To be able to determine whether an install or an app open event came from a
 link we have to submit some events to our servers to be able to match the event to a link click
 detected by us. If you are very concerned about
